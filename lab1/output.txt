       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default if omitted),
              'auto', or 'never'; more info below
       Using  color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
       with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
       standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
       variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors  command  to  set
       it.
